Description: Download, run, customize, and deploy your own instance of intRo.
    The intRo package provides a small set of functions designed for the easy
    customization of the default set of intRo options. For instance, the set of
    modules, the order that the modules appear, and the theme of the application
    can be specified. Users can then deploy an instance of intRo onto the
    ShinyApps.io web service.
