Thank you in advance for reviewing our manuscript "Introductory statistics with `intRo`", which I have submitted for consideration of publication in the Journal of Computational and Graphical Statistics.

This paper details an interactive web-based statistical software application intended for use in an introductory statistics classroom. We introduce the tool as well as an accompanying R package to ease the process of deploying intRo within a curriculum. Additionally, the paper describes the process for extending the functionality in intRo in order to personalize the software.

Thank you for your consideration of our submission.
